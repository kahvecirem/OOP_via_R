- The constructor method (`initialize`)

### Lesson 3: Inheritance in R

- Basics of inheritance
- Creating child classes
- Inheriting properties from parent classes
- Method overriding and superclasses

### Lesson 4: Polymorphism in R

- Polymorphism and its significance
- Implementing polymorphism through inheritance
- Special methods (e.g., `print` and `summary`)

## Intermediate Level

### Lesson 5: Abstract Classes and Methods

- Implementing abstract classes
- Defining abstract methods
- Extending abstract classes

- Understanding interfaces
- Using S4 classes as interfaces
- Implementing multiple interfaces in a class

### Lesson 7: Managing Data with OOP

- Encapsulating data with classes
- Getter and setter methods
- Data validation and control

## Advanced Level

### Lesson 8: Advanced OOP Concepts

- Advanced topics in OOP
- Method dispatch in R
- Object-oriented design patterns

### Lesson 9: Practical Projects

- Developing practical projects using OOP in R
- Building a data analysis pipeline with OOP
- Designing custom data structures

## Gene-Related Examples

To illustrate OOP concepts, let's explore examples related to genes:

### Gene Class

```r
setClass(
  "Gene",
  representation(
    name = "character",
    sequence = "character"
  ),
  prototype(
    name = character(0),
    sequence = character(0)
  )
)

Gene <- function(name, sequence) {
  new("Gene", name = name, sequence = sequence)
}

mutate <- function(gene, new_sequence) {
  gene@sequence <- new_sequence
}

print.Gene <- function(gene) {
  cat("Name:", gene@name, "\nSequence:", gene@sequence, "\n")
}

# Usage example
gene1 <- Gene("Gene A", "ATGCGTA")
print(gene1)
mutate(gene1, "ATGCTTA")
print(gene1)
